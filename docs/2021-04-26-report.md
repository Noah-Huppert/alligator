# Overview
I have implemented mechanisms to perform some sanity checks on the allocator implementation. The following are my results from the sanity checks.

# Memory Usage
By setting a breakpoint in the `MetaPage::alloc` function I determined that the MetaPage uses 25,066 bytes of memory.

I will use `perf mem record <binary>` to measure memory usage and `perf mem report` to view memory usage (see [this Red Hat article on `perf mem`](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/monitoring_and_managing_system_status_and_performance/profiling-memory-accesses-with-perf-mem_monitoring-and-managing-system-status-and-performance) for more).
